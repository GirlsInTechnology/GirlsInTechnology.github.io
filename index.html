    <p>Our generation has been the most blessed one regarding the technical advancement. We have seen a simple pager developed into multifunctional smart phones, a 128 gb hard drive into a tiny micro SD card. Familiarity with so many technological advancement made me feel really comfortable to study and make my career in this field. An opportunity in tech is without any doubt a very important thing to me because I have already set a goal to continue learning and practicing more in this field. We all know that technical field is the most promising field worldwide. Being a computer science student, I feel that the opportunities these days for those who study technology related subjects are overwhelming. Studying technology related subjects prepare person up for a career in a wide variety of industries such as engineering, architecture, information technology, careers in hospitality, fashion and even education. One can learn it and go to fields you like to study in the future.</p>

    <p>Entire globe has grown to an era where billions of individual needs are attached to the internet. We are at a verge, where almost all discrete needs can be contented by the usage of technology. Soon, we shall arrive at a tipping point where the survival of any surreal businesses will be directly dependent over technology. At such a time of technological evolution, technological literacy and practices must be accessible to every individual, without any hindrances.  
Technological advancement is an outcome of innovative and iterative practices and progressive transformation of the existing technology, by passionate people. Providing opportunities to a large mass of such passionate people would integrate the prevailing dynamic growth of the technology.
I, personally believe, unleashing opportunities in technology equals giving a free rein to innovations, which eases living.

    <p>Well to be honest, I never thought I would be joining the path of technology, as I intended to build up my career in medical field. But my bad I couldn’t get an entrance to medical school because of some delicate reasons. After my failure to involve in medical sector, I was confused, agonized, and scared to select my next career option. But however after so much of consults and suggestion I came to choose the field of technology. When I was advised to join IT by my beloved people I was not so ready to confront this sector. Once I got involved in it I found it interesting as well as challenging and tough at the same time.

As I mentioned I was scared to join IT sector not only because I was not prepared for that but also because I counted myself among the below averages in mathematics and computer knowledge. This fear of mine did not served me well. At the very beginning when I started learning things about technology I felt like if I was doomed. My fear started to turn into my anger and then agony, I was not able to take things into my mind, and I felt as if I choose the wrong path. But patience is something each and every one should have, which I could manage to have during my starter period. With my consistent hard work, full time dedication and will power to achieve something in IT field I managed to learn programing. Though I started learning it was not so easy, many time I pushed myself into dilemma of leaving, but fortunately I didn’t. Now I am good at my works and love programming, finally I made a cut after years of dedication and hard work. And another proud moment will be the one when I will be counted as one among the few girls involved in technology field in our country. 
With the enrollment, what I personally feel of technology, is the only arena where girls can compete with boys and prove their skills, strength and ability. Not only this, women with technology skills are more likely to possess different personality. With success queuing behind us we can influence many other to join this sector as this might be the only field which will keep growing and growing. 
Participation: 
 I have participated and enjoyed myself in motivational program, organized by Girls in Technology Nepal, to increase the enrollment of girls in technology. I felt great towards GIT as they gave me the chance to involve in various programs as member part of technology. 

 And beside that I have participated and personally involved in many programs organized by Pride Nepal and many other organizations, among those programs I individually assisted my team during relief program organized by them after the massive earthquake that hit Nepal on 24th April 2015.
